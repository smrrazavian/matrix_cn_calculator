## What is Condition Number?

Condition number is a measure of the sensitivity of a function's output with respect to its input. In the context of a matrix, it is the ratio of the largest singular value of the matrix to the smallest singular value of the matrix. The smaller the condition number, the better conditioned the matrix is. A matrix with a condition number of 1 is a perfectly conditioned matrix.
